Don’t let anyone tell you folk isn’t cool. Auckland alt-folk 3 part Forbidden Joe includes the diverse musical backgrounds of Frances Dickinson, Emily Giles and Alex Borwick and the unique instrumentation of concertina, banjo, cello and trombone, to build an unprecedented modern day folk sound. Frances picked a few favourites on Felt and disclosed her crafty part - read the full story right here.

Sounds Crafty can be a special series of craft showcases picked by Kiwi musicians, bands and DJs, released throughout New Zealand Music Month. Offering Julia Deans, Urbantramper, Hikoikoi and Rosy Tin Teacaddy this year 2010, and previously featuring artists such as Minuit’s Ruth Carr, Nathan King, The Twitch’s Fleur Jack, singer/songwriter Flip Grater and Hera, Sounds Crafty delivers rhythm and craft alongside one another and realizes what NZ musos make of everything.

Which singer’s mosaic lion took satisfaction of place in her dad’s garage area? Which Kiwi muso secretly loves lacy coat hangers? These intriguing questions and more will get answered on Felt through the month of May. Stayed tuned!
