Felt is New Zealand’s online marketplace for locally made merchandise and gifts - your one stop shop for top quality, original items manufactured in Aotearoa. Felt is normally proudly owned and managed by Kiwi makers who understand that buying local products is better for everybody (and saves dosh over time!). We believe craftsmanship and sustainable intake could save the environment, and we’re right here to greatly help that happen.
